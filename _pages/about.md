Hey ðŸ‘‹! 

My name is Shashvat, and I am 10th-grader currently attending San Mateo High School. I enjoy learning about new things and just love to explore new subjects. Whether it be understading the complexities of math, experminting in science class, or writing stories in english class, I always do my best to expand my skills and knowledge.

Outside of academics, I am involved in many extracurricular activities. I was a team captain of my robotics team, Vortex Robotics, through which I enjoyed working on new and exiting projects as well as competing with FTC competitions with my team. I also take part in my schools varsity Mock Trial team, where I play the role of a witness helping me practice critical thinking and strengthing my public speaking skills. I am also a part of my school's soccer team, which has taught me the importance of teamwork and dedication. Additionally, I also love to tutor and coach other students in various subjects I am familier with, such as 3D modeling and robotics. I am currently tutoring 3D modeling to a student and help coach Vortex Robotics.

Outher than my extracurriculars, most of my free time is spent in the kitchen, cooking for myself and my family. I also love coding, which I have been doing since 6th grade. I'm proficient with Python and Java and have basic knowledge in HTML and CSS. My goal is to push toward a career in STEM, specifically computer science and engineering, so that I can combine my skills of problem-solving and creativity to develop innovative solutions to real-world problems.
