Hello! My name is Shashvat, and I am a 10th-grade student at San Mateo High School. I have a deep passion for learning and exploring new subjects. Whether it's diving into the complexities of mathematics, experimenting in the science lab, or crafting stories in English class, I always strive to expand my knowledge and skills.

Outside of academics, I am actively involved in various extracurricular activities. I was the team captain of Vortex Robotics, a community robotics team, where I enjoy working on innovative projects and competing in FTC competitions. Additionally, I play for the school's soccer team, which has taught me the importance of teamwork and perseverance.

In my free time, I love cooking and consistently cook for myself and my family. I also enjoy coding and have been learning different programming languages since 6th grade to build my own projects. I am fluent in Python and Java and know some HTML and CSS. My goal is to pursue a career in technology, where I can combine my love for problem-solving and creativity to make a positive impact on the world.
